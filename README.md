# Robofriends

This is the "Robofriends" app, which was originally designed as a tutorial for beginners learning React, created by Andrei Neagoie of Zero-To-Mastery fame. On the surface, the app displays "cards" generated by the React compnents which display a picture of a randomly-generated robot, a name and an email address, all supplied and stored in an array. The app then allows a user to search through these cards for a robot by typing in the robot's name in the provided search bar.
